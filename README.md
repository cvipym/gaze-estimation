# Gaze Estimation (Mediapipe)
> This is Gaze Estimation Project, here we will use coputer vision techniques to extracting the eyes and irises, mediapipe python modules will provide the landmarks
## Description
### 1. Collecting Data
- Saving images for feature extraction
- Dividing and saving into 9 classes
### 2. Data Analysis
- Landmark extraction using Mediapipe
- Parameter extraction from landmarks
- Feature Generation
- Complete fomula for determining gaze direction
### 3. Demo
- Provide a demonstration of the implemented gaze direction determination system

## Installation
### 1. opencv
```
pip install opencv-python
```
### 2. mediapipe
```
pip install mediapipe
```
